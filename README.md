# World Happiness Planet Index

This research will examine what determines the happiness of a country and will focus on developing our own model to predict happiness of country. Our response variable is the Happiness Planet Index (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/?fbclid=IwAR37naSOvjBPwztHvARL7I3J4F60H7yD2-9DUuO98Xrb1HJsBsk2U0_EdQs) rank based on different values of the explanatory variables. The HPI value is collected in 2009, 2012, 2016. The index is based partly on information gathered by Gallup Poll but also on census data such as life expectancy, GPD, population, etc. In this research, we will develop regression model to assess the best explanatory variables to predict the happiness index of the country. Furthermore, we are planning to compare HPI between region. The sample size of 2009 is 143, 2012 is 150, and 2016 is 140. Therefore, we have total 433 observations.  

Our explanatory variables include:
  * Region
  * Year
  * Life Satisfaction (reported as a mean score between 0-10)
  * Life Expectancy (in years)
  * Footprint (g ha/cap)
  * Healthy Life Years (HLY)
  * Purchasing Power Parity
  * Population Density
  * Government Corruption
  * The difference of happiness within the country (Standard deviation of ladder by country-year) 
  * Human Development Index: a statistic composite index of life expectancy
  * Education level
  * Percentage of cell phone users
  * Percentage of wifi access in home
  
After building our final model, we want to focus if the following factors produce better prediction by Extra Sum of Squares:
  * Percentage of women completing secondary education
  *
